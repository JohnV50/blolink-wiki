# Nicknames Templates üî¨

## Changing your nickname template

There are two ways to set up a nickname template. Choose your preferred method below!

{% hint style="warning" %}
To set a nickname template, you need to have the `Manage server` permission enabled for the intended server.
{% endhint %}



**Using the Bloxlink Dashboard:** \
The quickest way to set a nickname template for _**all users**_ who join your server, is to use the [Dashboard](https://blox.link/dashboard/user/servers). Once on the dashboard and logged in, select your server under the `Manage Servers` tab. Next, click the `Verification` tab. Under `Default Nickname Template`, choose the nickname template that you would like to apply to your server, then click save.

\
**Using the Bloxlink Bot:**\
To set a nickname template for _**all users**_ that verify/join the server, you can run `/setup`. Under the prompt, select `next`. You should see a list of all available nickname templates for you to choose from. Once you find your preferred template, select the `Type Response` button and type in your template. You also have the option to select `Disable` if you don't want Bloxlink to change a user's nickname. Proceed with the prompt until the end by selecting `skip` to leave all other settings unchanged.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[üß†](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:** Templates must be spelled like Bloxlink shows you! You must include the curly brackets and dash. For example: `{smart-name}`
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
[üßô](https://emojipedia.org/mage/) **Tips:** **Bind Nickname** ‚Üí when you link groups, you're given the option to change nicknames of group members. Bloxlink will choose the person's **highest role** which has an available Bind Nickname. Bind Nicknames can be applied from /`bind`. If no bind nicknames apply to the user, then the **Global Nickname** is used instead.

**Global Nickname** ‚Üí the default nickname used if someone has **NO** available Bind Nicknames. This can be applied from this command and `/settings` (look for "NicknameTemplate").
{% endhint %}

That's all! You have changed/edited your nickname template.

Thanks for using Bloxlink. [‚ù§Ô∏è](https://emojipedia.org/red-heart/)
