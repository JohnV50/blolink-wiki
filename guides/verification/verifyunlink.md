## How do I switch my primary account?

Firstly you’ll have to add your new Roblox account to Bloxlink, the account you want to use as your new primary account. Use the `!verify add` command for that or go to [blox.link/verify](https://blox.link/verify). Do you need a hand? Watch this part of our verification tutorial:

[🧠](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:** When you are about to link your new account, make sure to tick the “Primary Account” box when you are typing in the Roblox name. _-This is an important step._ This will then set the new account you are about to link, as your primary account.

Great! You have linked your new account, and it is set as your primary now. Let's unlink your old account!  
Head to [blox.link/account](https://blox.link/account) and go to the `Roblox Accounts` section.
