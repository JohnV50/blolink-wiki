# Frequently Asked Questions 📜

## Q1) How do I verify?

The first step to verifying is running /`verify` in any server. Bloxlink will send you a link to our website and you can verify from there. If you're having any issues, we do have a guide to help you:

{% content-ref url="../guides/verification/verify.md" %}
[verify.md](../guides/verification/verify.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Q2) How do I access the website?

The website can be found by going into a browser and typing `blox.link` in your search bar. You can also [click here](https://blox.link).

## Q5) Why is Bloxlink not changing my nickname?

This is most likely because you are the server owner. This is a thing that Discord made bots unable to, and not Bloxlink. We can’t do anything about it, so you must just name yourself manually.

In case you are not the server owner, then it might have something to do with Bloxlink’s permissions. Firstly, make sure to drag the bot to the top of the roles you want it to change nicknames on. If it still doesn’t change your nickname, ensure Bloxlink has the `Manage Nicknames` permission.

## Q6) I deleted my data! How do I get it back?

Once you have deleted your data, **there is nothing we can do about it**. The page **warns** you multiple times and even asks for confirmation before you delete your data. This is not our fault as you were warned about this and we can not do anything to fix it. You **must** wait 2 days before being able to verify again.

## Q7) Bloxlink is not responding. What do I do?

There is a few reasons Bloxlink may not be responding to you. First off, do `@Bloxlink#6871 prefix`. Please remember to ping the bot, and not the Bloxlink role! Sometimes, your prefix might be different so the bot is not responding. If the bot is offline, an update and/or outage could be happening, check our status channel on Discord for more information. Be patient as this is being fixed as soon as possible.

## Q8) How do I link my Roblox group?

If you have administrative permission in a server, you may run `/setup` and follow the prompts in the channel the command was ran in.\
If you have difficulties in finding the group ID, just take the numbers (from the URL) just before the group name _or you can just take the entire URL._

If you have already ran a setup, you can use the command called `/bind` instead;

`1` Firstly you would have to run `/bind`, then choose `group`

`2` Now you will have to set the `nicknameTemplate` for this group bind. (Most common nickname template is to use their Roblox usernames, which is `{roblox-name}` or click `skip` if you do not want one.)

`3` You'll be prompted if you want your users roles to be removed if they meet the bind requirements, choose based on your preference! This is an advanced option, if you don't really know how it works, click `skip`.

`4` Finally, enter your group ID. After that say `entire group`. _(If you have difficulties in finding the group ID, just take the numbers (from the URL) just before the group name. Or you can just take the entire URL)._

## Q9) How do I set up a nickname template?

There are two ways to set up a nickname template. Choose your preferred method below!

{% hint style="warning" %}
To set a nickname template, you need to have the `manage server` permission enabled for the intended server.
{% endhint %}



**Using the Bloxlink Dashboard:** \
The quickest way to set a nickname template for _**all users**_ who verify/join your server is to use the [Dashboard](https://blox.link/dashboard). Once on the dashboard and logged in, select your server under the `Manage Servers` tab. Next, click the `Verification` tab. Under `Default Nickname Template`, choose the nickname template that you would like to apply to your server, then click save.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Here is a brief explanation of each template and its purpose. We highly recommend using {smart-name} as it is the most used template!**\


{smart-name} → changes to: display name (@username) if the user has a display name; otherwise, changes to their Roblox username

{roblox-name} → changes to their Roblox Username

{display-name} → changes to their Roblox Display Name

{roblox-id} → changes to their Roblox user ID&#x20;

{roblox-age} → changes to their Roblox user age in days&#x20;

{roblox-join-date} → changes to their Roblox join date&#x20;

{group-rank} → changes to their group rank&#x20;

{group-rank-ID} → changes to their group rank in a group with ID&#x20;

{discord-name} → changes to their Discord display name; works on unverified users {discord-nick} → changes to their Discord nickname; works on unverified users&#x20;

{server-name} → changes to the server name; works on unverified users&#x20;

{clan-tag} → replaceable text that the user can set
{% endhint %}

\
**Using the Bloxlink Bot:**\
To set a nickname template for _**all users**_ that verify/join the server, you can run `/setup`. Under the prompt, select `next`. You should see a list of all available nickname templates for you to choose from. Once you find your preferred template, select the `Type Response` button and type in your template. You also have the option to select `Disable` if you don't want Bloxlink to change a user's nickname. Proceed with the prompt until the end by selecting `skip` to leave all other settings unchanged.

## Q10) What is Bloxlink Canary? How do I use it?

Bloxlink Canary is a feature bot, that is updated to test out our new features, currently Canary is not available to use anymore and is no longer supported.

## Q11) Why does Bloxlink Pro keep saying my server is not authorized to use Bloxlink Pro?

This can be because the **server owner** doesn’t have a Bloxlink subscription license. You will only be able to use premium/pro in the server if the server owner owns a Bloxlink subscription. If you wish to transfer this license to a friend that owns a server where you’d like to use the features of premium/pro, then you can transfer your license by visiting the my subscriptions tab via the [dashboard.](https://blox.link/dashboard)

This might also be due to you not actually having the Pro license. If you bought Bloxlink Premium Lifetime once it was available, then that’s why. Bloxlink Premium and Bloxlink Pro **is not** the same. Bloxlink Premium gives you access to the commands under “Premium” displayed in `/help`. Bloxlink Pro means you have the ability to invite `Bloxlink Pro#2989` to your server. You can check your Bloxlink subscription license by using the command`/server status.`

## Q12) I bought Bloxlink Pro! Do I have to redo all my binds and setup?

No, you don’t have to do anything over again. Data are synced with the server, which means settings, binds, prefix and everything else will remain the same as before if you decide to invite Bloxlink Pro to your server.\
The same happens if you one day want to cancel your Bloxlink subscription. Things will still be synced to the server, and it will remain the same on the normal Bloxlink.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[🧠](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:** Once you cancel your subscription you must re-invite the normal Bloxlink, as Bloxlink Pro is only for active Bloxlink premium/Pro subscribers.
{% endhint %}

## Q13) What are magic roles? How do I set them?

Magic roles are roles that will allow you to do administrative things ONLY within Bloxlink!

For example if you want to allow someone to run the `/update or` `/verifyall` command, but don't want to grant them the `Manage Server` permission. That's what these "Magic Roles" do. There are 3 types of magic roles:

**Bloxlink Bypass:** This will make Bloxlink ignore the people with this role. They will for example be ignored if someone runs `/update` on them. This way they can have a custom name and have roles that Bloxlink would normally remove.

**Bloxlink Updater:** This will allow people to run the `/update` command on others as well as the `/verifyall` command. This is very smart if you for example updated someone's group rank, and want someone to update the "suspect".

**Bloxlink Admin:** This will allow people to be able to run **all** commands with Bloxlink. This is a dangerous role to give people, if you don't trust them. Be careful, cause they will be able to change settings within Bloxlink, delete binds (linked groups and other binds), setup the bot again and such administrative permissions.

{% hint style="warning" %}
[🧠](https://emojipedia.org/brain/) **Note:** You don't have to set **any** actual permissions for these roles. It's coded in the bot.\
Please also make sure that you spell them correct, as if you don't it won't work (Yes, capitalization also matters!). **Bloxlink Bypass**, **Bloxlink Updater**, **Bloxlink Admin**.
{% endhint %}

## Q14) I have modified my settings/binds but it did not take effect!

If you have a Trello board linked to your server, then the bot will only load up to **100** cards from the board. If you have more than 100 total cards on your board, then the bot might fail to find the Trello cards to remove/modify. So, changing settings in your server will appear to have no effect. It's recommended to use a brand new board for your Bloxlink settings and binds.

{% hint style="danger" %}
[🚨](https://emojipedia.org/police-car-light/) **Warning**: The Trello function has been deprecated. You can not link a Trello board anymore. If you have linked one, it is recommended to switch to the normal settings without Trello!\
Having difficulties switching to the normal settings? Visit our [support center](https://blox.link/support).
{% endhint %}

## Q15) People are not getting their roles!

If you have Membership Screening enabled in your Server Settings, then Bloxlink will wait until **after** the user accepts the rules before giving them their roles. This is because giving roles makes a user bypass the Membership Screening, so Bloxlink will always wait until after the user accepts the rules.\
If you don't have Membership Screening enabled, then most likely the bot **is** giving them their roles, but your Discord client isn't showing it. This is a problem with Discord, not the bot, the role is in fact being given to the person. You can double-check by looking at the audit log.

## Q16) I see no servers/wrong servers when I try to verify!

You're logged on the wrong account on the website. Go to [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/), log out, and log back in with your correct account. Then go back to the Bloxlink website and sign in.

## Q17) I verified on the website but Bloxlink says I didn't!

If your verification was successful on the website, but Bloxlink says you're not, most likely you're logged into the wrong Discord account **on the website**.
